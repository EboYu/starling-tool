# This file tells `bench.sh` which benchmarks to run.
#
# Each line is formatted as follows:
#
# Name:Path:GRASShopper module path
#
# If the third is missing, the proof is run as a Z3 proof.
#
# Benchmarks are emitted as a LaTeX table, sorted alphabetically and grouped by Group.
#
# Lines starting with # are discarded.  Whitespace is significant.
